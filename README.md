                            INSTRUCTION TO EXECUTE THE FILE
**************************************************************************************

0. I have attatched two files that will make the small shell work. Those being smallsh.c and smallsh.h

1. Make sure you are in the same directory as the files with your terminal.

2. To make the small shell executable use this command: gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c

3. This should create a smallsh executable file.

4. From there you can use a test file to run the tests on this file as it will be readable.
