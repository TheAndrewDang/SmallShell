                            INSTRUCTION TO EXECUTE THE FILE
**************************************************************************************

0. I have attatched two files that will make the small shell work. Those being smallsh.c and smallsh.h

1. Make sure you are in the same directory as the files with your terminal.

2. To make the small shell executable use this command: gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c

3. This should create a smallsh executable file.

4. From there you can use a test file to run the tests on this file as it will be readable.

Disclosure: I had some issues with my program running locally on VSCode but when running through the OS1
server it worked perfectly fine. If you run into the error where the status is printing repeatedly after
every process please let me know.

Thanks,
